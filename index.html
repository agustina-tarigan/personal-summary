					<h2> Hi, I'm Tina</h2>
					<h4> ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF</h4>
					<p>I started my career journey as an Internship Trainee in August 2015 at one of IT Startup based in Jakarta, and within three months I was promoted to a full-time position as a Project Management Associate, a position she held until I resigned from our company in November 2017.</p>
					<p>Throughout my time at the company, I showed great adaptability, being able to work on multiple projects using different web technologies and platforms. I learns fast on the job and is always curious about the latest technologies. I also can think as an end user of the product, which helped me write test cases while doing software QA/QC.</p>
					<p>I showed dedicated work ethics and high professionalism, with extra attention to details. These skills have been beneficial towards sharpening my ability to manage a project from start to finish. I have led projects from planning, execution to delivery, with ongoing project documentation and communication with upper management and the project team.</p><br/>
